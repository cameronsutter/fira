# Fira

##Description

Fira adds ease-of-use functionality to HTML files.

Instead of typing `id="foo"` or `class="foo bar"`, you can simply type `#foo` or `.foo .bar` in HTML tags (in the normal place where you put id or class attributes)

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'fira'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install fira

## Usage

To use Fira, rename HTML files to .html.fira and rails will automatically handle them. It will even evaluate embedded ruby code using Erubis. (note: Erubis runs after Fira)

Once in your Gemfile, Fira will be the default template_engine for <code>rails generate</code>, which means that view files that are normally .html.erb will now be .html.fira files.

##Examples

###Id's

    <div #my_id >

becomes

    <div id="my_id" >

###Classes

    <div .multiple .classes >

becomes

    <div class='multiple classes' >

###Data- attributes

    <div $city="Provo">

becomes

    <div data-city="Provo">
